# NETMIX-BACK

An innovative web app for finding, organising, reviewing and sharing Movies and TV Shows from all of the major online streaming providers.

I single handedly built Netmix over the course of just two weeks for my Flatiron School Final Project. In order to achieve the desired functionality I built a Rails backend that followed RESTful conventions and devised relationships for User, List, Listing, Content and Follow models.
